SpreeEssentialCms
=================

SpreeEssentialCms is a full featured CMS for managing pages and content on your [Spree](http://spreecommerce.com) site.

Installation
------------

If you don't already have an existing Spree site, [click here](https://gist.github.com/946719) then come back later... You can also read the Spree docs [here](http://spreecommerce.com/documentation/getting_started.html)...

Otherwise, follow these steps to get up and running with SpreeEssentialCms:

Add the necessary gems to your Gemfile... they haven't been released to Rubygems yet so we'll grab them from git.

    gem 'spree_essentials',    :git => 'git://github.com/citrus/spree_essentials.git'
    gem 'spree_essential_cms', :git => 'git://github.com/citrus/spree_essential_cms.git'

Run the generators to create the migration files.

    rails g spree_essentials:install
    rails g spree_essentials:cms

Now migrate your database...

    rake db:migrate
    
Boot your server and checkout the admin!

    rails s
    


Usage

[todo] add basic usage stuff here


### Here's some tips for making content really customized...


#### Contexts

Contexts allow you to place different forms of content in various places of a page. A slideshow or a sidebar might be good examples...

You can set a content's context (say that ten times fast!) under the 'Optional Fields' tab in the edit content view.

In your view you'll be able to grab those bits of content like so:

    
    .slideshow
      - if @slides = @page.for_context('slideshow')
        = render 'shared/content', :content => @slides
    
    - if @sidebar = @page.for_context('sidebar').first
      - content_for :sidebar do
        = render 'shared/your_custom_sidebar', :content => @sidebar  




#### Custom image sizes

Use a content decorator when you want different contexts to have their own image sizes:


    Content.class_eval do 
    
      # override default image sizes
      def default_attachment_sizes
        { :mini => '48x48>', :medium => '427x287>' }
      end
      
      # or set a custom size for each context
      def attachment_sizes
        case context
          when 'slideshow'
            sizes = default_attachment_sizes.merge(:slide => '955x476#')
          when 'main'
            sizes = default_attachment_sizes.merge(:custom => '580x289#')
          when 'small-top'
            sizes = default_attachment_sizes.merge(:custom => '364x177#')
          when 'small-bottom'
            sizes = default_attachment_sizes.merge(:custom => '364x109#') 
          else
            sizes = default_attachment_sizes
        end
        sizes
      end
    
    end
